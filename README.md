# Dank Troll Hunt (DTH) 🧌

**Dank Troll Hunt** ($DTH) is a MemeFi AR game + staking ecosystem built to combine **Pokémon Go nostalgia, troll culture, and Web3 staking mechanics** into one CEX-ready project.  

## 🌟 Core Utilities
- **AR Troll Hunt Game** → Hunt trolls in real-world hotspots, earn NFTs + rewards.
- **Staking Caverns (Phase 3)** → Temporary staking pools powered by Smithii.
- **Infinite Possibilities Staking (IPS)** → Multi-tier, fee-loop staking model (future dApp).
- **Community DAO** → Contributors shape the project, earn rewards, and decide upgrades.

## 📈 Roadmap (Simplified)
- Phase 1: Stealth launch + foundation wallets
- Phase 2: Public flip + socials + manifesto
- Phase 3: Troll Caverns via Smithii pools
- Phase 4: IPS custom dApp
- Phase 5: Scaling (CoinGecko, CMC, CEX listings)
